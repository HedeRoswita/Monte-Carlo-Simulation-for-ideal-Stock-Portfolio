# Monte Carlo Simulation for ideal Stock Portfolio

This project aims to help individuals construct an optimal stock portfolio for 2024, focusing on six stellar companies identified by Forbes. Utilizing a potent combination of Monte Carlo simulation and efficient frontier analysis, we delve into a rich dataset of 5 years of historical data for these promising players.

Through thousands of simulated scenarios, the Monte Carlo engine explores a vast landscape of potential future market fluctuations. Leveraging this intricate model, we then construct the efficient frontier, a map guiding us towards portfolios offering the highest possible return for their level of risk.

In-depth calculations are performed to understand the intricacies of each portfolio:

1. Annual returns: Uncover the projected average income for each investment.
2. Volatility: Gauge the fluctuations inherent in each option.
3. Portfolio weight optimization: Determine the ideal allocation of investments to maximize returns while minimizing risk.
4. Adjusted risk of return: Analyze the return achieved per unit of risk taken, providing a nuanced understanding of each portfolio's efficiency by calculating the Sharper ratio.

   
These insights equip individuals with powerful tools for decision-making, enabling them to choose a portfolio that aligns with their risk tolerance and return expectations. By peering into the future through Monte Carlo simulations and navigating the efficient frontier, this project empowers individuals to make informed investment choices for a profitable 2024.
